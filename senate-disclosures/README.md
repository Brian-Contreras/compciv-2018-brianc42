	I’m interested in looking at which category of person — Senators or Senate candidates — is more likely to file an Extension or an Amendment to a financial disclosure statement. Because the Financial Disclosure website disaggregates Senators from Senate candidates, it’s easy to identify which category an individual falls into. My task, then, would be to parse the name of each document filed by each person, categorize it based on type of document (normal filing, extension filing, amendment filing), identify trends in which type of person files a greater ratio of which type of document, and display that data. One quirk to this process will be that I’ll have to account for the fact that elected Senators will obviously file more documents overall than candidates do since they can hold their seats for several years (whereas candidates can only run every so often, and oftentimes will only run once). To solve this, I plan to also parse the year in which each document was filed and then divide the number of each documents filed by the number of years in which documents were filed. This way my data will be about the number of Extensions and Amendments filed (by both Senators and Senate candidates) in an average year, rather than ever.

Some sources I’m interested in using are:

https://www.ethics.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/financialdisclosure?p=overview
This page by the Senate’s Select Committee on Ethics, which lays out the regulations and bylaws in place that determine who has to file what, and by when. It also goes into the policies outlining the process for getting an extension. These regulations apply to both Senators and Senate candidates;

This NYT article detailing a case in which former Senator Harry Reid was pressured to amend his filings after it was discovered that he had not disclosed two tracks of land he had purchased. It explores the difference between “technical corrections” versus “errors” in the documents;

http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/senator-corker-financial-disclosure/
This Fortune article describing a case where it was discovered that Senator Bob Corker had failed to disclose millions of dollars of investment income. The article notes that “Senators often amend financial-disclosure forms” while also showing how media attention can force such amendments to be made;

http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article205359299.html
This recent story about a Senate candidate from Missouri who is catching heat for not disclosing certain conflicts of interest in his financial disclosure forms. This speaks more to the candidate-specific side of things;

And this article exploring the process by which disclosures are made accessible to the public, including what happens when changes are made after the fact. It notes that “about two dozen required filers, including more than a dozen senators, were granted extensions.”
